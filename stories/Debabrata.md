I started my open source journey with small HTML and CSS contributions. At first, I was nervous about making mistakes, but the community was welcoming and supportive. Over time, I learned how to collaborate using GitHub, improve my coding standards, and solve real problems. Participating in Hacktoberfest motivated me to explore more projects and contribute regularly. I now feel confident to take on larger projects and help others in the community.
