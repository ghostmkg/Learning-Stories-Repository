# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Sanket Rajput
**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** September 2024
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** C, C++, Java, Python, React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GitHub, Bun, MongoDB, Node.js, Kotlin, Blockchain (Ethers.js, MetaMask), Flask

**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**
I started my open-source journey while exploring projects for GSoC and hackathons. Initially, I focused on learning the basics of GitHubâ€”commits, pushes, and managing repositories. Over time, I built real-world projects like a mental health chatbot, ScamShield (AI-based scam call detector), and CampusVote (blockchain-based voting platform). Open source gave me exposure to working with diverse technologiesâ€”from system programming in C to building AI dashboards with React and Next.js. Each contribution, big or small, boosted my confidence and connected me with the global developer community. What excites me most is solving real-world problems while constantly improving my coding skills.

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**
Start small but stay consistentâ€”fix a typo, improve docs, or add a simple feature. Each step builds your confidence, and soon youâ€™ll find yourself solving bigger issues and contributing meaningfully. ðŸš€
