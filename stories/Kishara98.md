# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Kishara Buddika
**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** October 2025
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Git, GitHub, Markdown
**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**
I started my open source journey with Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous because contributing to public repositories felt complicated. But once I learned the basics of forking, branching, and making pull requests, it became much clearer. My first contribution was creating a unique Python project, FileSystem_Organizer.py, which helped me automate file organization. This gave me confidence to contribute more in the future. I realized that open source is not just about codeâ€”itâ€™s about collaboration, documentation, and sharing experiences.

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**
Start small. Even adding documentation or sharing your story counts. The important thing is to learn the workflow and take the first stepâ€”youâ€™ll grow from there!
