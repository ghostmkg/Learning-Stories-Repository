# My Learning Story âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Kishara (Kishara98)
ðŸ“… **Date:** October 25, 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tech / Tools:** Git, GitHub, Markdown

ðŸŒŸ **My Journey:**
I began exploring open source during Hacktoberfest. At first, contributing felt overwhelming - there are so many projects and perceived expectations. I started small by reading contribution guides and improving documentation. That tiny first PR (fixing a typo and adding a short usage note) was accepted and it changed everything: I gained confidence to open another PR and learn more about Git workflows.

Over time I picked up basic Git commands, learned to create branches, and understood how to open a clear PR with a helpful description. Each contribution taught me something new - about code, collaboration, or how to ask for help.

ðŸ“Œ **What I learned:**
- Start small - documentation fixes, tests, and examples are great first contributions.
- Read the project's contributing guidelines and follow the repo's coding and commit style.
- Be patient and polite in PR conversations. Maintainers are often volunteers.

ðŸ’¡ **Advice for new contributors:**
If you're nervous, find issues labeled "good first issue" or "documentation". Try to reproduce the project locally for small changes and ask for clarification on an issue before writing code.
