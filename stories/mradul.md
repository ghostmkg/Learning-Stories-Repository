# My Open Source Journey ✨

_👤 Name:_ mradul deodhiya  
_📅 First Contribution:_ October 2025  
_🔧 Tools/Tech Used:_ Python, Git, GitHub, Markdown

_🌟 My Experience:_  
When I first discovered open source, I thought it was only for experts. But one day, I decided to try — I forked a repo, wrote my story, and made my first pull request. That simple act taught me how contributions really work. Seeing my PR merged gave me confidence that I truly belonged here.

_📌 Advice for Beginners:_  
Start small. Every contribution — no matter how tiny — makes you part of something big. 🌍
