# 🌱 My Tech Journey — Himanshu Verma

Hey everyone! I’m Himanshu Verma, a Computer Science student at Newton School of Technology.  
My journey into tech started long before college — back when I was still in school, curious about how things really worked behind the screen.

## 🧩 How It All Started
It began with simple curiosity: taking apart computers, exploring file systems, and messing with random software just to see what would happen.  
That curiosity slowly turned into learning — from writing basic Java programs to experimenting with Linux distributions. I’ve tested everything from **Mint** and **Zorin** to **Arch Linux**, learning how systems actually function under the hood.

I even built my own **Java-based shell** that handles commands like `echo`, `exit`, and `type`, and learned how PATH resolution works. That project really sparked my love for backend logic and problem-solving.

## 🧠 Learning & Growth
Along the way, I got interested in **ethical hacking** and **penetration testing**, trying to understand not just how to build things — but how to break and secure them.  

I’ve also explored **open source** projects and tools, created an **npm package** to help others easily add consistent headers and footers to their web projects, and participated in events like **Hacktoberfest**, where I learned the value of contributing to a community.

## ⚙️ Where I’m Headed
Right now, I’m focusing on improving my DSA, mastering Java fundamentals, and strengthening my problem-solving skills. I’m also learning how to balance tech with consistency, discipline, and creativity — especially after going through phases where I lost motivation.

But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that passion can fade — and still be rebuilt stronger than before.  
I’m not just coding for grades anymore; I’m coding to understand, to grow, and to make something meaningful that my parents can be proud of.

### 💬 Final Note
If you’re reading this and you’ve ever felt stuck or lost in your tech journey — don’t quit. Take breaks, explore, rebuild.  
Because sometimes, losing your spark is the first step toward finding your fire again.
