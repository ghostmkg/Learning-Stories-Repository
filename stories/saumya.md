My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Saumya Prakash
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025 
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Javascript, GitHub, Markdown  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I am starting my open source contribution journey with this. Although I have made several projects in different domains such as frontend, backend, and Python, I never contributed to open source projects before. I am very excited for my first PR request to be accepted.I have done several projects, but when it came to contributing to open source, I used to get afraid. Now I realize it wasn't that difficultâ€”the big mountain of fear was just stopping me from starting. Finally, after breaking through those mountains of fear, I stepped forward and began my journey as an open source contributor.
ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Based on my experience, I suggest: don't wait for the right time, because the right time is when you start. Once you begin your journey, you will find your own path. You never know what is going to happenâ€”you might start with fixing minor typos and end up fixing bigger codebases! ðŸš€
