ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**

I began my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2025**. At first, I was nervousâ€”I thought contributing required being an expert coder. But I quickly discovered that open source values *all kinds of contributions*: fixing bugs, enhancing documentation, or adding beginner-friendly features.

My very first PR was adding an unknown job site to the repo after that i have added some of my python solutions to some repos

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**

ðŸ’¡ Donâ€™t wait until you feel "ready" or "perfect." Start smallâ€”fix a typo, improve documentation, or tackle a simple feature. Every contribution matters, and each step helps you learn, grow, and become part of the open-source community. ðŸš€
