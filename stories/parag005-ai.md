# My Open Source Journey 🚀

👤 **Name:** Parag Hemraj Patil
📅 **First Contribution:** This will be my very first step into open source  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** HTML,CSS,Python,Js.

🌟 **My Experience:**

I started my ML engineer journey in may 2024, driven by curiosity and the desire to bring ideas to life. One of my first major projects was a predicting the crop disease,predicting the level of PM2.5,predicting the free parking slots and writing clean, maintainable code.  

Working on this project gave me hands-on experience with python, Numpy, Matplotlib, and pandas, and it also taught me how to think like both a developer and a user. Along the way, I realized how powerful collaboration and community support can be.  

Now, I’m stepping into the open source world with excitement. This is my first contribution, but I see it as the beginning of a much bigger journey. For me, open source is not just about code it’s about learning, sharing, and being part of something larger than myself.  

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait until you feel “ready.” Start from where you are, keep learning step by step, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes that’s where the real growth happens.
