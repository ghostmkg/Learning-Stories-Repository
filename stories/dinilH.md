# My Open Source Journey ✨

## 🌟 My Experience

I began my open source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, Git and GitHub felt a bit overwhelming, but the open source community was incredibly supportive. My first contribution involved fixing documentation issues — a small step that helped me understand the complete PR workflow. Since then, I've contributed to multiple repositories, learning about collaborative development, version control, and the value of effective communication.

Open source has boosted my confidence, strengthened my technical and teamwork skills, and allowed me to connect with inspiring developers from around the world.
