🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics, checking those small detials and testing.  

My first PR was fixing a small typo in documentation/changing the colour of a button and it got merged! Its just done recently and im doing it now.

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source!'

If u don't know where and what to know just ask someone and they'll help u as long as ur interested in doing it.
