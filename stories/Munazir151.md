# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Munazir Ansari 
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2024
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** HTML , CSS, Javascript, React.js, Github

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2024. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered that many projects welcomed all kinds of contributions—from improving documentation to writing tutorials and designing graphics.


📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀
