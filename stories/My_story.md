**Experience:**  
During a highly intensive 48-hour hackathon, my team and I set out to build an innovative Legal Document Analyzer aimed at helping lawyers and researchers quickly extract insights from large volumes of case files. From the start, we planned to deliver a secure, user-friendly tool that combined AI-powered text extraction with a modern frontend.

We chose Python for backend processing and Streamlit for rapid UI development. Integrating Firebase Authentication was crucial for securing user access, but initial configuration issues caused frustrating auth errors. Through persistent debugging and consultation with documentation and community forums, we resolved these challenges efficiently.

Integrating Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and Gemini AI models enabled us to perform advanced natural language processing tasks like entity recognition, summarization, and sentiment analysis on uploaded PDFs. The Google Cloud set-up required careful service account configuration and IAM permissions, which became our secondary hurdle before smooth processing.

Our iterative development process was supported by continuous version control on GitHub and collaborative notebook development using Jupyter. We also created comprehensive README documentation and demo videos to facilitate easy onboarding.

One of the most rewarding moments was watching the tool analyze a complex legal document in seconds, highlighting key sections and generating concise summaries that would otherwise take hours manually. The project was not without its bumps, especially time constraints and deployment glitches, but swift teamwork, clear task division, and adaptive problem solving helped us deliver a polished final product just in time.

**Advice:**  
Approach hackathons with a clear plan but stay flexible; unexpected challenges will come but can become your best learning moments. Prioritize core features and keep communication flowing among your team regularly. Don’t underestimate the power of documentation and proper environment setup—it saves hours later. Lastly, use these events to learn new tools, share your knowledge, and build lasting collaborations. The experience will boost your skills far beyond just the technology you use.
