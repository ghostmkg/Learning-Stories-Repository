🗺️ The Start of My Journey

I began my open-source journey in 2022, working on small DSA practice codes and initial Python/JavaScript projects. Back then, my biggest challenge was understanding pull requests and Git workflows.

By 2025, I am working as an ASR backend developer at a startup, managing backend systems, servers, and databases. Despite my professional work, I continue contributing to open-source DSA repositories and participate actively in Hacktoberfest.

🎯 My First Contribution: DSA Problem Implementations
Contribution Type: Code Submission

My first contribution involved fixing simple issues and submitting DSA solutions to public repositories. Through this process, I learned the essential GitHub workflow:

Forking repositories.

Creating branches for isolated work.

Pushing code to my fork.

Submitting Pull Requests to the original repository.

The most rewarding moment was seeing my contributions merged, which gave me confidence to continue contributing to open-source projects.

💡 Lessons Learned & Advice
My Advice for Fellow Beginners:

Start contributing even with small steps. Every addition—whether fixing issues, adding code examples, or improving documentation—is valuable.

"Your first commit doesn’t need to be perfect. Start small, keep learning, and enjoy the journey!" 🚀

🙏 Closing Thoughts

Open source has been an incredible learning experience since 2022. Balancing professional backend work in 2025 with Hacktoberfest contributions has strengthened my skills in coding, Git, and server management, and I look forward to continuing my contributions to the community.
