# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Shristi

**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** October 2025

**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Python

**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**
I began my open source journey by participating in Hacktoberfest 2025.
At first, I started by making comments and slowly progressed to making real contributions.
It was challenging, and I thought of quitting, but I reminded myself that if I stop trying, Iâ€™ll never know whatâ€™s on the other side of participating and contributing.
Looking back, even though itâ€™s been only a few days, Iâ€™ve learned how to create issues, make pull requests, leave meaningful comments, and much more.

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**
All you have to do is **never give up, no matter what.**
