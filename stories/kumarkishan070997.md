## ğŸŒŸ My Experience

I started my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2023**. At first, I felt nervous because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding to contribute. But I soon realized that even small contributionsâ€”like fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding beginner-friendly featuresâ€”are highly appreciated and valuable.

My first PR was on a **Php project** where I fixed a small UI bug, and it got merged quickly! That positive experience gave me the confidence to contribute more. Since then, Iâ€™ve contributed to multiple projects, explored different tech stacks, and learned how collaboration truly works in open-source development.
