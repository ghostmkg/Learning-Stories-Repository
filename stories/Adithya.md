# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Adithya Surisetti 
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** C++, GitHub, Python 

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025 this year .At first, I hesitated to contribute because I assumed only expert coders could make a difference. But through a friend's help I realised contributing doesnt only require coding knowledge — from adding comments to code making it more readable to using AI for help to improve codes , even these small things matter and helped me to grow and learn about this space.


My very first pull request is adding comments to my friends repository — I dont really expect it to count for hacktoberfest but still it gave me the motivation, the push i needed to actually start contributing. Taking this step gave me the confidence to actually code and contribute by finding the errors or just improving the code for better output.


📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – use AI, there is nothing wrong in that as you will learn in that process how to improve the code yourself eventually. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀🔥
