**🌟 My Experience:**  
My open-source journey began in June 2025, when I decided to step out of my comfort zone and contribute to real-world projects. Initially, the process felt a bit overwhelming, but once I grasped the workflow of forking repositories, creating branches, and submitting pull requests, everything started to fall into place. Through this experience, I learned how to collaborate effectively with other developers, adhere to contribution guidelines, and write cleaner, more maintainable code. Each contribution—no matter how small—provided a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue improving. Open source has not only strengthened my technical skills but also helped me grow into a more confident and well-connected developer.

**📌 Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait for the “perfect” project to begin. Start small—choose a simple repository, read the documentation thoroughly, and make your first pull request. You’ll learn far more through hands-on experience than by waiting for the ideal opportunity. Every line of code you contribute is a step toward growth and improvement.
