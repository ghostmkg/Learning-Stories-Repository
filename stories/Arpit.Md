ðŸ“– Description

I would like to add my open-source learning story to the repository as part of Hacktoberfest 2025.

This will include:

A new file stories/ishanpeshkar.md
My journey, starting with my first contribution here.
Tools Iâ€™ve used, my experience, and advice for beginners.
âœ… Checklist

âœ… I have followed the contribution guidelines.

âœ… My file will be placed inside the stories/ folder.

âœ… The filename will be ishanpeshkar.md.

âœ… The story follows the required format (Name, Date, Tools, Experience, Advice).

This issue is to track my contribution of adding a new story to the repo. It will help beginners see real examples of learning journeys and encourage more first-time contributors.
