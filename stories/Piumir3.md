**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** October 2025  
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Java, Git, GitHub, VS Code  
**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**  
I started exploring open source during Hacktoberfest 2025. Contributing code has helped me understand collaborative development, version control, and best coding practices. Working on small projects like star patterns, number triangles, and Tower of Hanoi improved my problem-solving skills and confidence in Java. I also learned how to write clean, modular code and document it properly for others. Overall, it has been a rewarding journey of learning and sharing.  

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small, focus on understanding the code, and donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions. Every contribution counts, no matter how simple!
