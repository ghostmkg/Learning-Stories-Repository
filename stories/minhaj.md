# My Learning Adventure ðŸš€

ðŸ‘¤ *Name:* [Minhaj Ahmed]  
ðŸ“… *First Contribution:* August 2024
ðŸ”§ *Tools/Tech Used:* VS Code, Git, Markdown, Github, C++, JavaScript

ðŸŒŸ *My Experience:*  
I began my learning journey with curiosity and a bit of uncertainty. Exploring new tools and reading stories from others inspired me to try things myself. My first project was chromo dino-game clone and sharing them with friends, which helped me build confidence.

As I continued, I started contributing by good first issue and experimented with coding, replaced links, wrote simple scripts for cli, fixed typo and contributed to semi-big projects. Each small achievement motivated me to keep going and learn more.

ðŸ“Œ *Advice for Beginners:*  
Start with what excites you. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions or make mistakes. Every step forward is progress, and sharing your journey can inspire others too! ðŸŒ±
