# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I began my open-source journey during **Summer-WAP-Open-Source(NST-SDC) 2025**. At first, I wasnâ€™t confident enough to contribute because I thought contributing meant solving complex issues. But soon I realized that open source welcomes all kinds of contributions â€” from fixing UI bugs to improving documentation.  

In my first few attempts, some of my PRs didnâ€™t get merged, but instead of stopping, I learned from every rejection. I explored how to fork a repo, clone projects, create new branches, make changes, and raise pull requests properly. Each step made me more confident and technically strong.  

Now, Iâ€™ve successfully contributed to several web development repositories â€” improving designs, fixing bugs, and adding new features. This journey taught me the real meaning of collaboration and consistency.  

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start now. Donâ€™t wait to be an expert before contributing. Even small changes matter â€” fixing a typo, improving README files, or solving minor bugs. The key is **to stay consistent and keep learning**. Every PR you make adds to your experience ðŸš€
