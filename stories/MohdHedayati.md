# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Mohammed Mehdi Hedayati  
**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** October 2025  
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Python, C++, Git, GitHub

**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**  
My open-source journey began as a small step to understand how real-world projects work â€” and it quickly became something I loved. I started by exploring beginner-friendly repositories, learning how to fork, clone, and contribute effectively. The sense of collaboration and community amazed me â€” people from around the world working together to improve ideas and code. Through contributions, I improved my problem-solving, documentation, and communication skills. Each pull request taught me something new, and I began to see coding as a team sport rather than a solo challenge.  

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small â€” even fixing a typo counts. Every contribution adds up and helps you grow faster than you think!
