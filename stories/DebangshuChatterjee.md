### 🌟 My Experience
My open-source journey began with curiosity and a desire to learn by building real-world solutions. I started contributing during **GSSoC 2024**, where I worked on projects related to **IoT, Web Development, and Machine Learning**. Through my contributions, I not only improved my coding skills but also learned the value of collaboration, documentation, and community-driven innovation.  
Open source allowed me to share ideas freely, explore different technologies, and connect with developers around the world. It gave me a platform to grow, mentor, and contribute back to the tech ecosystem that shaped me.

### 📌 Advice for Beginners
> 💡 **Start small but stay consistent.** Even a single line of documentation, fixing a bug, or improving a README counts. What matters most is understanding, learning, and connecting with the community. Every contribution—no matter how small—pushes you forward in your developer journey.
