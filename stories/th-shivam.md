# ðŸ’» My Learning Story â€“ Journey into the World of Programming

**By Shivam Singh**

## The Beginning

Since childhood, I've always been fascinated by technology â€” playing games, exploring apps, and wondering, **"How are these things made?"**

That curiosity slowly opened the door to a new universe â€” the world of programming.

My beginning was simple â€” watching free YouTube tutorials, learning a bit of C language, and writing my first `"Hello World"` program.

That one line changed everything for me â€” because for the first time, I felt, **"I can create something of my own."**

## The Struggle & Growth

Then came the real struggle â€” errors, bugs, missing semicolons, and endless debugging. ðŸ˜…

But every mistake taught me something valuable.

I soon realized that programming isn't just about writing code â€” **it's about learning how to think.**

From **C** to **Python**, from **HTML** to **Java** â€” every language had something new to offer.

Some taught logic, some structure, some creativity, and some patience.

And the biggest lesson of all was:

> **"Writing code is easy, but understanding your code is an art."**

## My First Project & Open Source Contribution

I still remember building my first project â€” it was simple, but for me, it was a huge achievement.

That was the moment I realized, **"I'm not just learning anymore, I'm creating."**

Then came a turning point in my journey â€” **my first open source contribution at GSSoC'25** (GirlScript Summer of Code 2025).

Contributing to open source taught me collaboration, real-world problem-solving, and the value of community-driven development.

It wasn't just about writing code anymore â€” it was about **being part of something bigger**.

And that's how my developer journey truly began â€” filled with errors, but glowing with progress.

## The Journey Continues

Even today, whenever I learn a new concept, I feel the same excitement as I did when I first wrote code.

Programming is no longer just a skill for me â€” **it has become a part of who I am.**

And I know this learning will never stop, because in the world of programming:

> **"The moment you stop learning, you stop growing."**

## Closing Thoughts

No matter how many sleepless nights I spend debugging or how long it takes to fix a small logic â€” every line of code feels like a story.

And my story is still being writtenâ€¦ **one line of code at a time.** ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
