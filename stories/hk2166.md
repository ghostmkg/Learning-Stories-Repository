## ðŸŒŸ My Experience  
I started my journey as an engineering student exploring full-stack development and AI/ML projects. Over time, Iâ€™ve worked on innovative solutions like a voice-first cooking assistant, forest fire simulation using AI, and AI-powered teaching tools for low-resource classrooms. Each project has taught me the importance of combining traditional methods with cutting-edge technology. I enjoy building systems that are practical, impactful, and accessible to users. My learning continues every day as I experiment, iterate, and refine my skills.

## ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners  
Focus on building real projects, not just learning theory â€” hands-on experience teaches lessons no textbook can.
