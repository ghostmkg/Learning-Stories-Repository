ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**
I started my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2023**. At first, I felt uncertain about where to begin since everything seemed so technical. However, as I explored more projects, I realized that open source is not just about coding â€” itâ€™s about collaboration, learning, and community. I contributed through documentation updates, design improvements, and small bug fixes, which helped me gain confidence and understand real-world project workflows.
