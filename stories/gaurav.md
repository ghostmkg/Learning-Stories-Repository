# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Gaurav Uniyal
ðŸ“… First Contribution: October 2025  
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: C++, Python, Git, GitHub, Markdown  
ðŸŒŸ My Experience:  
My open source journey began when I contributed my first PR to the **dsa-codes** repository, where I solved the classic *Two Sum* problem in C++. That was my very first merged PR, and it gave me a lot of confidence.  

Now, Iâ€™m working on my second contribution â€” sharing my story in the **Learning Stories** repo. Through these contributions, Iâ€™ve learned how to fork repositories, clone them locally, make changes, and raise pull requests. I also realized that contributions donâ€™t always have to be code â€” documenting experiences and helping others is equally valuable.

I started exploring open source out of curiosity during Hacktoberfest. At first, I was unsure about where to begin, but soon realized that contributions donâ€™t always have to be code. Writing stories, improving docs, and sharing experiences are just as valuable.  
Through this contribution, I learned how to fork a repo, clone it locally, make changes, and create a pull request. It gave me a lot more confidence to participate in open source projects. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and contributing more in the future.  


Each step has made me more confident and motivated to continue exploring and contributing to open source. ðŸš€  

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:  
Start with something simple â€” even a small code contribution or writing your story can be meaningful. Every contribution matters, and itâ€™s the best way to learn and grow. ðŸŒ±
