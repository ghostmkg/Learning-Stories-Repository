My Open Source Journey ✨

🔧 Tech & Tools Used: Java, DSA, Spring Boot, GitHub, MongoDB, MySQL

🌟 My Experience:
I recently began my open-source journey with a lot of curiosity and excitement. As a fresher, I wanted to explore how developers collaborate globally and how real-world projects evolve through teamwork. At first, I wasn’t sure where to start, but diving into GitHub helped me understand the process and build my confidence.

I’ve added two repositories to my GitHub profile — each representing a small step in learning, experimenting, and contributing to something meaningful. Through this, I’ve realized that open source is not only about coding but also about sharing ideas, improving existing work, and constantly learning from the community.

Every commit and repository setup has taught me something new — from managing backend connections using Spring Boot and databases like MySQL and MongoDB to writing cleaner, more efficient code in Java. This experience has inspired me to keep exploring, contributing, and growing as a developer. 🌱

📌 Advice for Beginners:
Don’t wait until you feel “ready.” Just begin — even setting up your first repo or fixing a small issue counts! Every contribution, no matter how small, brings you closer to becoming part of the open-source community. 🚀
