## Date
October 31, 2025

## Observation
Today, I observed Ella eagerly working on her first art portfolio. She carefully selected her favorite drawings and paintings, explaining her choices with excitement. Her focus and pride in her work were evident as she organized her art pieces into a booklet.

## Reflection
This activity highlighted Ella’s developing fine motor skills and her ability to organize her work. It also boosted her confidence in her creative abilities and her sense of accomplishment.

## Learning
Ella learned how to curate her artwork, improving her decision-making skills and her ability to reflect on her own progress. This task also encouraged her to take pride in her creativity and effort.

## Next Steps
Encourage Ella to keep adding to her portfolio regularly, perhaps including other art forms like sculpture or digital art. We can also introduce her to basic art critique, helping her articulate her feelings about her work.
