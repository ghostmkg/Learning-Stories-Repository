🌟 **His Journey:**
I started my open-source journey through college events. At first, I was just helping out on projects made by my seniors, and they guided me a lot. I had registered for Hacktoberfest this year, but back then I was too new and didn’t do any contributions. That actually pushed me to learn more. Now in Hacktoberfest 2025, I finally made my first contribution! I realized open source is not just about writing code, it’s about learning, sharing, and being part of a community.

Since then, I’ve been trying out more projects and small fixes on my own. It feels nice to see that even little contributions can actually help someone or something.

📌 **Impact on the Game:**
Don’t worry about being perfect. Start small, ask for help when you need it, and just keep learning. Every little contribution matters!
