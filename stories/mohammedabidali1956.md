# My Open Source Journey ✨

**👤 Name:** Mohammed Abid ALi 
**📅 First Contribution:** October 2025  
**🔧 Tools/Tech Used:** GitHub, Markdown, Python (learning!)  

**🌟 My Experience:**  
This is my very first time contributing to open source, and honestly, it feels both exciting and a little scary—but in a good way!  
I’ve always heard about the open source community but wasn’t sure where to start. Thanks to a welcoming project and clear contribution guidelines, I was able to take that first step.  
Even though my contribution was small, it taught me a lot—about collaboration, version control, and the joy of building in public.  
I’m proud to be part of something bigger than myself, and I can’t wait to keep learning and contributing more.  

**📌 Advice for Beginners:**  
Just start. Even reading documentation or fixing a typo is a valuable contribution.  
The open source community is full of learners—there’s a place for you here! 🌍✨
