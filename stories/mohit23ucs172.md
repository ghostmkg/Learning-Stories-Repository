My Open Source Journey âœ¨
ðŸ‘¤ Name: Mohit Tiwari
ðŸ“… First Contribution: Oct 2025
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: React.js, Node.js, Express.js (MERN Stack), MongoDB, Git/GitHub, C++, Python
ðŸŒŸ My Experience: My journey truly kicked off with full-stack development during my SDE Internship, where I contributed to real-world backend and frontend systems using the MERN stack. This practical exposure immediately translated to open source, as I applied best practices in modular design, API integration, and version control. Building projects like a Food Delivery App and a real-time QuickChat App taught me the importance of collaborative development, especially handling dependencies and using tools like Socket.IO and JWT. My background in Competitive Programming (350+ LeetCode problems) has also been crucial, strengthening my algorithmic approach to problem-solving and debugging complex code issues in collaborative environments. The open-source community provides the perfect platform to transition theoretical knowledge into practical, shared applications.
ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners: Don't separate competitive coding from open source. Use your DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) knowledge to understand and optimize algorithms you find in large repositories. Start by contributing high-quality, well-tested codeâ€”even small fixesâ€”to projects that align with your strongest technical skill (like C++ or Python).
