ðŸŒŸ **My Experience**:
My open-source journey kicked off during oct 2025 hacktober fest, a leap I took without fully grasping what open source meant. I stumbled into it, curious and a bit lost, thanks to a friendâ€™s nudge. , I felt a rush of prideâ€”it was my first taste of being part of something bigger, sparking a love for coding thatâ€™s grown ever since.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners**:
Donâ€™t expect it to be smoothâ€”I struggled with Git errors and permissions at first. Start small, like I did, and donâ€™t shy away from asking for help when stuck. Every hurdle teaches you something! ðŸš€
