## ðŸŒŸ My Experience  

My open-source journey began in **GSSoCâ€™25**, where I contributed to real-world projects and collaborated with developers from diverse backgrounds. Setting up repositories, fixing bugs, and raising my first pull request gave me a sense of growth and belonging in the developer community.  

During this time, I also came across **Hacktoberfest**, which motivated me to continue contributing and learning through open-source projects â€” and this contribution is a part of that initiative.  

These experiences taught me more than just coding: I learned how to read complex codebases, maintain version control, and communicate effectively within a team. They strengthened my technical skills and gave me the confidence to keep exploring the world of collaborative development.
