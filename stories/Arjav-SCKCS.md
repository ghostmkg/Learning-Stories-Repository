# My Open Source Contribution to Spring Cloud âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Arjav Dongaonkar
**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** Feb 2025
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Java
**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:** I began exploring Spring Cloud Kubernetes to use it as a Config Server, to integrate Kubernetes Secrets along with other property sources like Vault or GitHub. During my exploration, I discovered that while each source could be configured individually, composite configurations werenâ€™t yet supported. This gap intrigued me, and I started mapping out a possible solution.

I raised an issue on GitHub to share my findings, which soon caught the attention of the maintainer. After a quick discussion and presenting my approach, I was encouraged to implement it. Within just a week, my very first contribution, I had a working pull request ready, complete with business logic and test cases.

The maintainers provided detailed reviews, which helped me refine and improve the implementation. Finally, the PR was merged and released in the following month. Seeing my name in the release notes was a surreal and motivating moment. one that continues to inspire me to contribute more.

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:** Listen carefully to maintainers. Read their review comments multiple times, even if they seem simple. Their feedback comes from deep understanding and experience with the repository. Focus on 2â€“3 projects consistently, keep an eye on open issues, and keep contributing. The learning and satisfaction youâ€™ll gain are truly worth it.
