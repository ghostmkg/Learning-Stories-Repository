# My Open Source Journey 🚀

👤 **Name:** Anukalp Pandey @anukalp2804
📅 **First Contribution:** This will be my very first step into open source  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** HTML, Css, Java, SQL

🌟 **My Experience:**

I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2023. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.  

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait until you feel “ready.” Start from where you are, keep learning step by step, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes that’s where the real growth happens.
