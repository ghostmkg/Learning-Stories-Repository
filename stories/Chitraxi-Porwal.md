# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Chitraxi Porwal  
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Git, GitHub, C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, md files and DSA questions 

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. 
At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. 
But then I discovered Grow with Code youtube channel and came to know that for contributing to open source you don't need to be expert at coding. 
We can start with the small changes that will definitely create a huge impact.

I raised my first first PR in dsa-code repo by ghostmkg where I simply created an Age Calculator which calculates your age in years, months, weeks, days, hours and minutes. It also shows when your birthday will arrive next time.

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, modify readme.md or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! 🚀

Thank you for reading my experience.
