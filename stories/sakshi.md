# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Sakshi Gopal Jadhav 
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** JavaScript, GitHub, Markdown  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.  

My first PR was adding few JavaScript DSA programs to a repo of dsa-code in GitHub.
