### 🌟 My Experience
I’ve been working in the IT industry for over 13 years, and for the past 8 of those, automation testing has been my playground. What started as writing basic Selenium scripts evolved into building robust frameworks for web, API, and mobile automation.  

I’ve had the joy (and sometimes pain 😅) of wrestling with flaky tests, asynchronous waits, cross-platform quirks, and device fragmentation. Along the way I picked up tools like Playwright, Protractor, Rest Assured, and explored newer AI/ML-powered automation platforms like Testim and TestProject.  

Each project taught me something new — how to make tests more reliable, more maintainable, and how to stay ahead by learning the latest in testing techniques. My passion is solving the messy parts so that software works well, and automation just “doesn’t break.”

### 📌 Advice for Beginners
Don’t chase tools or fancy frameworks at the start — focus on **making small wins**: writing a good, reliable test, understanding the why behind flakiness, learning how to debug your automation.  

These small concrete improvements build up faster than trying to master every new tool at once.
