My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 Name: Abhijai Sharma
📅 First Contribution: October 2025
🔧 Tools/Tech Used: Python, PyTorch.

🌟 My Experience:
My open source journey started with curiosity and a little fear — fear of breaking something in a public repo. But once I made my first pull request, that fear turned into excitement. I realized open source isn’t just about writing perfect code; it’s about collaboration, learning, and growth.
Contributing taught me how professional projects are structured, how to write clean commits, and how to communicate effectively in a developer community. The moment my PR got merged, it felt like a small win in a big world of endless opportunities.

📌 Advice for Beginners:
Don’t wait until you “feel ready.” Jump in, read the contribution guidelines carefully, and ask questions — the open source community is far more welcoming than you think. Every contribution, no matter how small, moves you forward. 🚀
