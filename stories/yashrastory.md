🌟 **My Experience:**  
I am just starting my open source journey this year via Hacktoberfest 2025!I am really nervous about starting my journey in open source but at the same time very excited to learn new skills and grow in my tech career.

Till now I have made small contributions like fixing a typo, writing small codes, writing blogs etc. I am looking forward to learn more and contribute as much as I can. 

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog and many more. Every contribution matters in open source!!
