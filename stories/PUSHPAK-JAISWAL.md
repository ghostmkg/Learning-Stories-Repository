# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Pushpak M. Jaiswal

**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** March 2024

**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Java, FastAPI, Git, GitHub, React, Spring Boot

**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**
Contributing to open source has been one of the most rewarding parts of my tech journey. I started by exploring small issues in beginner-friendly repositories and gradually began building my own projects. Along the way, I learned about collaborative development, code reviews, and maintaining clean, readable code. I also started a few open-source ideas like PushDB â€” a decentralized blockchain-based database â€” and worked on AI-driven systems integrating multiple frameworks. Open source helped me grow not just as a developer but also as a problem solver and community member.

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**
Start small, stay consistent, and never hesitate to ask for help â€” every pull request, no matter how small, counts towards your growth. ðŸš€
