🏆 **Programming languages known:** Java, Python

🌟 **My Journey:**
I started coding when I was in class 7. I started my programming journey with HTML. Then, when I was in class 8, I started learning Java. I learned Java until class 10. I didn't do much programming in classes 11 and 12. After finishing high school, I chose Computer Science as my major and started my coding journey again.

I am totally new to open source. I am participating in Hacktoberfest for the first time. I am very excited about the open source journey ahead.

📌 **Advice for begginers:**
If you want to start contributing to open source, learn all the basic commands and concepts for Git, like forking, cloning, commits, branches, pull requests, etc. Once you have learned the basics, start contributing to open source and then learn advanced Git along the way.
