# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** Anand Kumar Patel
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, GitHub, Markdown, C  

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during GSSoC 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding.But I found some projects which don't require much coding skills but unfortunately none of my PRs get merged. In Hactoberfest 2025 i got second chance to conribute and this time i was able to get some of my PRs merged like Game in python, DSA code, and designing simple graphics.  

 I got some issues in between but I didn't step back. This time i do it again ,again and again. Now I know to to create fork , copy the code, makes changes, create PR ans many more new things all because i didn't step back.  

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small – fix a typo, write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source! This is the only way you can learn. If you wait to get perfect then to start you will learn nothing 🚀
