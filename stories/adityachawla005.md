🌟 **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during GoFr Summer of Code June 2025. At first, I was confused between the extensive details of Open Source Contributions.

But the progressive and welcoming nature of the organizers throughout helped me a lot.I experienced a whole new world of collaboration and plethora of contributors to work along with in this immersive environment.

I explored new technologies such as WebRTC to build a microservice on top of GoLang for real-time WebSockets bidirectional communication.


📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait to be “perfect” at coding. Start small but do explore!Even if you dont know the tech make sure to research well.Research is equally important.
