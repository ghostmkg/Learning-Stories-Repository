## ðŸ‘¤ Contributor Details

- **Name:** Pranav Kuruvella  
- **GitHub Username:** @PranavKuruvella

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2023. Initially, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert. But I quickly discovered that open source is about learning and collaborating. Iâ€™ve been particularly drawn to projects where I can explore **DSA in Java** and build applications with the **MERN stack**, which aligns with my interests in full-stack development and algorithmic problem-solving.

## ðŸ“– Story Details

- **First Contribution (Month/Year):** October 2023  
- **Tech/Tools Used:** Java (DSA), MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), Git, Markdown  
- **Short Summary (3-5 lines):**  
  My first contribution was to a beginner-friendly repository that helped me understand the pull request process and collaboration workflow. Since then, Iâ€™ve focused on improving my **DSA skills in Java** and learning the **MERN stack** to create full-stack applications. Open source has taught me that contributing isnâ€™t just about codeâ€”itâ€™s about learning, sharing, and growing as a developer.
