# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

- **Name:** Mohit Pandey
- **GitHub Username:** @binarymohit

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.  

## ðŸ“– Story Details

- **First Contribution (Month/Year):** October 2025
- **Tech/Tools Used:** HTML, CSS, C, JavaScript, Python, GitHub
- **Summary :**  
  My open-source journey began in Hacktoberfest 2025, where I contributed to beginner-friendly projects using HTML, CSS, and Python. I made small improvements in UI design and fixed documentation issues. The community support boosted my confidence and helped me grow as a developer.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start now. Donâ€™t wait to be an expert before contributing. Even small changes matter â€” fixing a typo, improving README files, or solving minor bugs. The key is **to stay consistent and keep learning**. Every PR you make adds to your experience ðŸš€
