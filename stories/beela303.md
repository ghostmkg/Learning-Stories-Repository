# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Nabila Abubakar (beela303)
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2023
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, JavaScript, Git, GitHub

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2023, I nearly didn't start back then because I was a little bit nervous and didn't know where to start but the best thing is to just start.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
You can do it alone with or without support even though it will be hard.
Use all the resources you can get, you must not pay for a course to get or learn what you need especially starting out.
You can't be perfect, there will always be bugs, things that may make you cry, feel like screaming your lungs out or throwing your laptop away BUT DON'T DO IT!!! KEEP GOING!!! DON'T STOP!!!
