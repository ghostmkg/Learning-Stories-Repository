# Story Of My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤**Name:** Sriza Paul
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** 5 October , 2025
ðŸ”§**Tools or Tech used:** C++,Java,Web Development


ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
My first open-source contribution during Hacktoberfest 2025 was both exciting and eye-opening. I added a Java solution for a coding problem and navigated Git and GitHub for the first time. At first, I doubted myself, thinking I wasnâ€™t experienced enough to contribute, but completing that small task gave me confidence and a sense of accomplishment. This experience taught me that open source is not just about code â€” itâ€™s about learning, collaborating, and growing together. It motivated me to keep exploring, take on bigger challenges, and believe that even small contributions can make a real impact. ðŸš€ðŸ’»


ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**
Start small, stay curious, and donâ€™t be afraid to make your first contribution â€” every step counts in open source!
