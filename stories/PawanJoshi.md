# My Open Source Learning Journey

**Name:** Pawan Joshi  
**Course:** B.Tech CSE  
**College:** Graphic Era Deemed University  

Hello! I’m Pawan Joshi. My journey in open source started as a curiosity to explore coding beyond my curriculum. At first, I was hesitant, but I soon realized the power of collaboration and community.

I began by contributing to small projects—fixing bugs, improving documentation, and learning Git along the way. Gradually, I started building my own projects, experimenting with **React**, **Node.js**,
and AI-powered applications. Each contribution taught me not just coding skills, but also problem-solving, teamwork, and the importance of version control.

One of my proudest achievements was developing a project that automates daily tasks using AI and sharing it with the community.  

Through open source, I’ve learned that consistent effort and learning from others can accelerate personal growth.  

I hope my story inspires others to start their own open source journey, no matter how small the first step may be!
