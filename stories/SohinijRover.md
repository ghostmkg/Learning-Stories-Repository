# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Sohini Joarder  
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2024
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** python, GitHub(SohinijRover), Markdown  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey with Hacktoberfest 2024. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. I had seen big projects and Hackathons and million LOC idearions. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.  

My first PR was adding few Python application programs to a repo of code in GitHub.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Donâ€™t be afraid to jump right in. It's easier than it looks and you'll get a lot of help around. Remember! Every contribution matters in open source! ðŸš€
