My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ“… First Contribution: October 2024 (Hacktoberfest)  
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: Python, React, GitHub  

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
Last year, I made my very first contribution during Hacktoberfest, and it was both exciting and eye-opening. I had been exploring open source for a while, but this was the first time I actually contributed. The issue I picked up was about fixing a div alignment problem in a React project. At first, I was nervous about whether my PR would be accepted, but once I submitted it, the community feedback was so supportive and encouraging. It made me realize how even a small contributionâ€”like fixing UI alignmentâ€”can have a real impact on a project. This experience motivated me to keep learning and contributing more, and it gave me confidence in collaborating on open-source projects.  

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:  
Stay consistent! Contributing once is great, but making it a habit will help you grow faster and gain more confidence in open source.
