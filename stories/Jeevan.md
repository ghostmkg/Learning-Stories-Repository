ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2025**. Initially, I thought contributing to open source required being an expert coder, but soon realized itâ€™s more about **learning, collaborating, and growing** with the community.

My **first PR** was for a **private repository written in Golang**, where I fixed logical issues and improved the code structure. It gave me valuable exposure to real-world collaboration, version control, and understanding how pull requests and code reviews work.

Since then, Iâ€™ve explored various repositories, learned about contribution guidelines, and slowly gained confidence in contributing to open-source projects. Every contribution â€” no matter how small â€” has helped me grow as a developer.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start now â€” not when you feel ready. Every small contribution matters, and the experience you gain along the way is what shapes your journey ðŸš€
