ðŸ‘¤ Name: Ayush Mittal
ðŸ“… First Contribution: October 2025
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: c++, GitHub, Markdown

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. I was very nervous, like how to start, how to contribute. This is my first story which I am contributing to Github Hacktoberfest
It is been a great learning for me, about the open-source and how impactful open sources are. They is much more to learn about it.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Don't just wait. Things don't happen, things are made to happen. Learn things and apply, there is ample resources and ample learning for everyone.
Happy Learn!!!!
