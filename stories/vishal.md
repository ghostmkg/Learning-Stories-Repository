ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** C++, Python, GitHub, Markdown, Java

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**
I began my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2025**. At first, I was a bit hesitant because I thought contributing to open source required being an expert programmer. But soon, I realized that open source is for everyone â€” whether youâ€™re fixing bugs, improving documentation, or adding new ideas to existing projects.

My first pull request was a simple code contribution, and when it got merged, it gave me a huge boost of confidence. That experience motivated me to keep learning, exploring new technologies, and contributing more actively. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on improving project documentation, building small C++ and Python projects, and sharing my learning experiences.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**
Donâ€™t wait until youâ€™re perfect at coding â€” start now! ðŸš€
Even small contributions like fixing typos, writing documentation, or improving code formatting make a difference. Every contribution counts and helps you grow as a developer and as part of the open-source community. ðŸ’»âœ¨
