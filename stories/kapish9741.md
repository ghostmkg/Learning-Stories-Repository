# 🌍 My Open Source Journey 🚀

👤 **Name:** Abhishek Kumar Patel  
📅 **First Contribution:** Taking my very first step into open source  
🛠️ **Tech Stack:** Next.js, React, Node.js, Express.js  


### 🌟 My Experience  

I began my web development journey in **August 2024**, driven by curiosity and the excitement of turning ideas into reality. One of my earliest projects was a **college dating website**, where I learned how to design intuitive user experiences, manage backend logic, and write clean, maintainable code.  

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with **Next.js, React, Node.js, and Express.js**, and learned to think from both the developer’s and the user’s perspectives. More importantly, I discovered the true value of collaboration, feedback, and community support.  

Now, as I take my **first step into open source**, I’m filled with excitement and curiosity. For me, open source isn’t just about writing code — it’s about **learning, sharing, and contributing** to something bigger than myself. This marks the beginning of a journey I’m eager to grow with.
