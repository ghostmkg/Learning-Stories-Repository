ðŸŒŸ My experience: 
My journey has just begun where I have started contributing towards the world of open source. These big words like repositories and terminals always confused me but now that I am putting myself out there and trying to learn they seem to be less scary. Just seeing how improving documentation and debugging can help contribute really motivates me forward. 

This is one of my first projects and I have gotten accepted by a few of my requests. However that did not discourage me and I intend to go forward and continue my journey by working hard towards contributing more. So I will keep moving forward and helping others. 


ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
There are so many people who do not even start, just by keeping your first foot forward you have already achieved a lot, so do not worry, in time you will learn and reach a level that once looked impossible.
