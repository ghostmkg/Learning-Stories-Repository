My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Vishal Maurya

ðŸ“… First Contribution: October 2025

ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: JavaScript, React, and C++

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I began my open source journey by participating in Hacktoberfest 2025.
At first, I started by making small comments and gradually progressed to making real contributions.
It was challenging at the beginning, and I even thought of giving up, but I reminded myself that if I stop trying, Iâ€™ll never know whatâ€™s on the other side of learning and contributing.
Looking back, even though itâ€™s been only a few days, Iâ€™ve learned how to create issues, make pull requests, leave meaningful comments, and collaborate with the community.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
All you have to do is never give up, no matter what. Keep learning, keep contributing!
