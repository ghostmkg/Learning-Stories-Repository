🌟 My Experience:

I began my web development journey in August 2024, driven by curiosity and a passion for turning ideas into reality. One of my first major projects was a dating website for my college, where I learned the importance of crafting intuitive user experiences, managing backend logic, and writing clean, scalable code.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with modern web technologies like Next.js, React, Node.js, and Express.js, while also exploring tools like Tailwind CSS and MongoDB to build efficient, dynamic applications. It helped me grow as both a developer and a problem solver, teaching me to think from the perspectives of users and developers alike.

Now, I’m stepping into the open source world with enthusiasm and curiosity. Though this is my first contribution, I see it as the start of an exciting and long-term journey. To me, open source isn’t just about code—it’s about collaboration, learning from others, and being part of a global community that builds together.
