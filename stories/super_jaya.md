# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, C++, Java

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I began my open-source journey form this Hacktoberfest 2025. Initially, I hesitated to contribute because I thought I had to be an expert coder. But then I discovered that many open-source projects welcome non-code contributionsâ€”like improving documentation, creating tutorials, and even designing simple graphics.

My first pull request was a solution to a LeetCode problem, and when it got merged. That moment boosted my confidence and motivated me to contribute more. Since then, Iâ€™ve written tutorials, published blog posts, and even translated README files into my native language.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Donâ€™t wait until you feel "perfect" at coding. Start smallâ€”whether it's fixing a typo, writing a blog post, or sharing your journey. Every contribution counts in open source, no matter how big or small! ðŸš€
