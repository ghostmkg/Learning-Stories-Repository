# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Bhavik Anand 
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, GitHub, Markdown  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. Although Iâ€™m new to open-source contributions, Iâ€™ve been actively learning and exploring. Initially, I believed that one had to be an expert coder to contribute, but soon realized that getting started is actually quite simple. As I explored different repositories and learned how contributions work, I discovered exciting opportunities to participate.

My first pull request was in a Code Files Repository, where I added some Python programs that I had created while learning the language and using them in my other projects.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Dont wait to be "perfect" at coding. Start small - fix a typo,write a blog, or share your story here. Every contribution matters in open source!
