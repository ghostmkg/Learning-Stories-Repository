Hi! I’m Ananya, a tech enthusiast with a growing passion for web development and programming.
I have a good understanding of HTML, which helps me build and design web pages, and I’m also exploring the exciting world of Python to strengthen my programming skills.

I love learning new technologies and enjoy creating simple, smart, and creative projects that make ideas come to life.
My goal is to keep improving and eventually build dynamic, AI-powered, and user-friendly applications.\
Looking towards my first contribution !!!!!
