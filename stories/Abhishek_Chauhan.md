# 🌟 My Open Source Journey – Abhishek Chauhan

Hello everyone! 👋  
I'm **Abhishek Chauhan**, a passionate Computer Science student and aspiring software developer who loves to learn, build, and contribute to meaningful projects.

## 🚀 How I Started

My journey into open source began when I realized how powerful collaboration and shared learning can be. I was fascinated by how developers from around the world work together to build amazing tools and solve real problems. I wanted to be part of that impact — to learn by contributing.

## 💻 My First Contribution

This is one of my first contributions to the open-source community. I’m adding a **sample LeetCode problem solution in Dart**, aiming to help others who want to explore problem-solving in different languages. It’s a small step, but every line of code counts toward growing as a developer and giving back to the community.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

Currently, I’m learning:

- Flutter & Dart for app development
- Python for automation and AI
- Angular and Web technologies for frontend development

## 🌈 Why I Love Open Source

Open source isn’t just about code — it’s about people, collaboration, and learning. It gives you a sense of belonging and purpose when your code helps someone across the world.

## 💬 My Message to New Contributors

Don’t wait to be an expert before contributing. Just start small — fix a typo, improve a readme, or add a new example. The community will guide you. Every contribution matters! 🌍
