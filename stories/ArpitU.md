## 🛤️ My Open Source Journey

I'm a newbie front-end developer who recently started learning about open source. My main stack includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently sharpening my skills in Git and GitHub.  

Even though I come from a front-end background, I'm very interested in contributing to Python projects — especially by fixing beginner-friendly bugs, improving documentation, and helping with small tasks that add value.

My journey began when I stumbled upon open source repositories labeled with `good first issue`. That made me realize there’s a whole world of collaborative coding out there where I can learn by doing and get better every day.

## 💡 What I’ve Learned

- How to fork a repo, clone it, and make pull requests  
- The importance of reading CONTRIBUTING.md and issue threads carefully  
- That it's okay to ask questions and seek help in discussions  
- How even small contributions like fixing typos or clarifying code comments can make a big impact

## 🧭 Advice for Other Beginners

- Start small — don't be afraid to pick tiny issues or documentation bugs  
- Look for repositories that are friendly to first-timers (check for labels like `good first issue`)  
- Learn Git and GitHub basics — they’re essential for open source  
- Be respectful, patient, and open to feedback — it's all part of the learning process  

I’m excited to continue learning, contributing, and connecting with the open source community. Here's to more pull requests and merged contributions ahead!
