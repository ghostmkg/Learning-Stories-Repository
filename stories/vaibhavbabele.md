# 🌟 My Open Source Journey – Vaibhav Babele

I first stepped into the world of open source during **Hacktoberfest 2024**. At that time, I was honestly nervous because I thought contributing required advanced coding knowledge. To my surprise, I discovered that open source welcomes every type of contribution—whether it’s fixing a typo, writing tutorials, translating docs, or even designing graphics.  

My very first PR was just a small typo fix, but when it got merged, it gave me a huge confidence boost. From there, I started contributing regularly and got involved in different community-driven programs.  

### 🚀 As a Contributor
- Social Summer of Code 2024  
- Social Winter of Code 2024  
- Social Summer of Code 2025  

These programs helped me improve my skills, work with real projects, and connect with mentors and contributors from across the world.  

### 🌍 As a Project Admin
- GirlScript Summer of Code 2025  
- Open Source Connect India 2025  

Taking up the role of a project admin was a turning point. I moved from being a contributor to mentoring new participants, managing projects, and guiding contributors. It was a chance to give back to the same ecosystem that once gave me opportunities to learn and grow.

### ✨ My Key Takeaway
Open source is more than just coding—it’s about **community, collaboration, and growth**. If you’re starting out, don’t wait to be perfect. Begin with small contributions, stay consistent, and the journey will open doors you never imagined.
