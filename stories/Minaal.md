# My Hacktoberfest Journey


## 🚀 Introduction :

Hello! I'm a Computer Science student from Bangalore who is deeply passionate about open-source development, blockchain technology, and collaborative innovation. My goal for Hacktoberfest 2025 was not only to contribute code but to share knowledge, connect with communities, and build meaningful tech.​


## 🌱 Open Source Contributions :

- Participated in Hacktoberfest 2025, submitting pull requests to projects that solve real-world problems and help beginners get started.​
- Contributed to improving documentation, fixing bugs, and adding new features in blockchain and web development repositories.​

- Advocated for beginner-friendly issues and mentored new contributors in open-source channels.​

## 💡 My Development Journey :

- Started with simple bug fixes and documentation enhancements, gradually moving to more complex feature additions. Each contribution taught me something new – from Git commands to large-scale repo workflows.​

## Hackathons & Community :

- Regularly participated in hackathons focused on blockchain and cloud technologies, often winning or receiving recognitions. Tech events and competitions helped polish both coding skills and teamwork.​

## 🛠️ Blockchain Expertise :

- Extensive experience building smart contracts, DApps, and tokens on protocols like Polygon and Ethereum.​

- Developed secure, scalable blockchain apps with Web3 integrations for payments, token management, and authentication.

- Led and contributed to community-driven projects, such as a user-friendly cryptocurrency platform (Torq) and decentralized preordering systems.

- Proficient with Solidity, Rust for blockchain environments.
