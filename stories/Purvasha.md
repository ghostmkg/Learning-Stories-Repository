ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
As a complete beginner, I was initially confused and hesitant about how open source contributions actually work. This PR is officially my first ever step into open source, and I am doing it through Hacktoberfest 2025. I started by learning how to fork a repo, make changes, and create a pull request. Even though it felt overwhelming at first, I slowly realized that open source is a welcoming space for learners too â€” and that gave me the confidence to begin.
