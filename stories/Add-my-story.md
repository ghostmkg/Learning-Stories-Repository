Title: 
My Learning Adventure ðŸš€

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Amaira
ðŸ“… First Contribution: June 2025
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: VS Code, Git, GitHub, Python, Flask, HTML, JavaScript

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I began my learning journey with curiosity and excitement, wanting to create something useful from scratch. My first project was a chatbot, which I built using Python and Flask. Sharing it with friends and seeing it in action gave me the confidence to explore more.
After that, I started contributing to open-source projects, tackling beginner-friendly issues, fixing typos, writing small scripts, and gradually moving on to larger contributions. Every small success taught me new skills and motivated me to keep going.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Start with what excites you. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions or make mistakes. Every step forward is progress, and sharing your journey can inspire others too! ðŸŒ±
