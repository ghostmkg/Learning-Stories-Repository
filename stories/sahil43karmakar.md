My Open Source Journey ðŸš€
ðŸ‘¤ Name: Sahil Karmakar
ðŸ“… First Contribution: Starting my open source journey with curiosity and courage
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: React, Tailwind CSS, Vite (beginner level)
ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I began exploring web development in 2024, fascinated by how simple lines of code could create powerful user experiences. My early projects focused on building clean, responsive UIs using React and Tailwind CSS â€” from form components to landing pages that actually feel good to use.
As a beginner, Iâ€™ve learned to value clarity, modularity, and demo polish. I love teaching others what I learn, especially through Hinglish explanations and dry runs that make even complex logic feel approachable. My goal is to build apps that not only work well but also empower users â€” whether theyâ€™re students, farmers, or first-time coders.
Now, Iâ€™m stepping into open source with excitement. This is my first contribution, but I see it as a gateway to learning from others, collaborating across borders, and sharing what I know. For me, open source is about community, curiosity, and continuous growth.
ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Start small, stay consistent, and donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions. Every PR, every bug fix, every README update â€” it all counts. Your journey is valid, and your voice matters
