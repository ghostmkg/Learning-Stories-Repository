# My Open Source Journey

**Name:** Keshav Chaudhary  
**First Contribution:** 11 October 2023
**Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Flask, GitHub  

**My Experience:**  
I began contributing to open-source projects in my second year. At first, I felt nervous and unsure if my work would be good enough. My first steps were smallâ€”fixing typos, updating documentation, and learning how to use Git properly. Over time, I realized that open source is not just about code, it is about people coming together to solve problems and share knowledge.  

Every pull request, no matter how small, helped me improve my skills in teamwork, communication, and writing clean, reusable code. One of the best parts of this journey has been receiving feedback from experienced contributorsâ€”it pushed me to think differently and learn faster.  

The welcoming nature of the open-source community showed me that learning is a continuous process. Open source made me more confident, more curious, and motivated to keep exploring new technologies while giving back to the community.  

**Advice for Beginners:**  
- Donâ€™t be afraid to start smallâ€”documentation, bug fixes, or even testing code are valuable contributions.  
- Learn the basics of Git and GitHub; it will make your journey smoother.  
- Focus on consistency rather than perfectionâ€”regular small contributions add up over time.  
- Ask questions, interact with the community, and never hesitate to seek help.  
- Most importantly, enjoy the processâ€”open source is about growing together! ðŸš€
