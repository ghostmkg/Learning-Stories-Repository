🌟 **My Experience:**  
I began my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2025**, and it was an amazing learning experience. This was my **first-ever pull request**, and honestly, I was both excited and nervous. I used to think that contributing to open source meant solving big, complex issues — but soon I realized that even the smallest improvements matter.  

From exploring repositories and reading contribution guidelines to forking, branching, and creating my first PR — every step taught me something new. I learned how real-world collaboration happens, how to communicate effectively through issues, and how even small code changes make a big difference.  

Though it was my first contribution, the process gave me a huge confidence boost and motivated me to keep exploring open source. I now understand that open source is not just about coding — it’s about **community, learning, and growth**.
