## ðŸŒŸ My Experience

My journey into open source began with Hacktoberfest 2025, where I discovered the joy of contributing to community-driven projects. My first major contribution involved creating a complete Simon Says Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

At first, I was intimidated by Git workflows and the idea of submitting pull requests. But the repositoryâ€™s clear contributing guidelines and the friendly community helped me learn quickly.
The most rewarding moment was seeing how my work inspired other developers who used and learned from the game. That experience showed me that open source is not just about writing codeâ€”itâ€™s about teamwork, learning, and lifting others up along the way.

Over time, I began exploring non-code contributions tooâ€”fixing documentation errors, translating content, and writing tutorials to help beginners. Each small step built my confidence and deepened my understanding of the collaborative spirit that defines open source.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings

- **Starting is crucial** - Starting small can lead to big learning momentsâ€”each task teaches valuable skills.
- **Start small but think big** - Even a simple game can teach complex concepts like DOM manipulation and game state management
- **Community makes the difference** - Open source thrives when people support and celebrate one another.

## ðŸ§­ Advice for Beginners

Start by reading the CONTRIBUTING.md file thoroughly and look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "beginner-friendly". Don't hesitate to ask questions in discussions or issue commentsâ€”the community is there to help. Also, make sure to test your changes locally before submitting a pull request.
