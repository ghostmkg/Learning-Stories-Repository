# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:**Soham Wankhede
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025    
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Java, GitHub, DevOps  

🌟 **My Experience:**    
I embarked on my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025, excited yet unsure of where I fit in. At first, I thought only expert developers could contribute meaningfully, but I quickly discovered the inclusive spirit of open source. Whether it's refining documentation, creating helpful tutorials, or offering simple designs, every contribution adds value. This realization opened a world of possibilities for me to learn, collaborate, and grow within this vibrant community.

My first pull request was a humble typo fix in documentation—small but monumental in building my confidence. This milestone fueled my passion to explore more: writing detailed tutorials, sharing my insights through blogs, and even translating README files into my native language. Each step has deepened my skills and connected me to amazing fellow contributors.

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**    
Don’t wait until you feel “perfect” to start contributing. Open source thrives on curiosity and effort. Begin with small actions—a typo fix, a blog post, or sharing what you’ve learned. Every bit helps build your journey and enriches the community.
