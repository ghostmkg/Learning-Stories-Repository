ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I started my open-source journey in October 2025 with curiosity and excitement to explore real-world collaboration. At first, I felt unsure about contributing, but I soon realized open source is about learning, sharing, and growing together. Contributing to projects like PlantPal and Rozgaar helped me understand backend development, Git workflows, and teamwork. Every pull request boosted my confidence and taught me how impactful community-driven development can be. Open source made me believe that every contributionâ€”big or smallâ€”matters.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Donâ€™t wait for the perfect moment to start. Begin small, explore projects that interest you, and learn by contributing. Every step counts in your open-source journey! ðŸš€
