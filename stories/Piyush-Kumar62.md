# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Piyush Kumar  
**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** October 2025  
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Git, GitHub, Java, HTML, Markdown  

**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:**  
October 2025 was my first real dive into open source, and it has been a great learning experience! I started smallâ€”improving documentation, fixing typos, and creating my profile README in the `profile-readme-templates` repo. Then I gradually moved to code contributions, adding Java solutions for problems like *Valid Parenthesis String*, *First Non-Repeated Character*, and *Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters*.  

Along the way, I opened issues, submitted PRs, and learned how to write clear commits, respond to feedback, and follow contribution guidelines. Sharing my personal learning story in the `Learning-Stories-Repository` felt amazingâ€”it was my first meaningful non-code contribution!  

This journey taught me that open source isnâ€™t just codingâ€”itâ€™s about learning, sharing, and collaborating. Every small PR and improvement helped me grow and build confidence to contribute more.  

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small, focus on learning, and donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions. Documentation, small fixes, or sharing your journey are just as valuable as code contributions. Consistency matters more than perfection.
