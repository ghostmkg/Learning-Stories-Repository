# The Rise of a Coder ⚽

🌟 **His Journey:**
My fascination with computers began way back in 3rd grade. I loved opening up machines, exploring their components, and experimenting with different software. Curiosity pushed me into programming early on—I started with C++ and slowly expanded into PHP, C#, Python, Java, .NET, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Rust, and more.

When I stepped into the industry in 2017, I found myself working in core development areas at big tech companies, primarily with Java and Spring Boot. Over the years, I’ve not only built scalable applications but also embraced full stack development with Angular and PostgreSQL, sharpening my craft one project at a time.

But beyond my full-time role, I code for fun. I explore new languages, build side projects, and keep learning because for me, coding has always been more than just a job, it’s a passion. Today, I also mentor freshers, guiding them through Java, Spring Boot, and modern development practices to help them build confidence in their careers.

📌 **Impact on the Game:**
A career in tech is not about knowing every tool—it’s about building curiosity, adapting, and growing continuously. Start small, stay consistent, and never stop exploring. The best developers aren’t those who know it all, but those who keep learning, sharing, and pushing boundaries.
