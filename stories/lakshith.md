# My Open Source Journey âœ¨  

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Lakshith  
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025  
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, AI/ML libraries, LaTeX, GitHub  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I recently started my open-source journey and I am deeply interested in contributing to **AI/ML, mathematics, and research papers**. Initially, I thought contributing meant solving extremely complex problems, but I soon realized that open source welcomes all kinds of contributions â€” from improving documentation to building research tools and small AI/ML modules.  

Even though I am just starting out, I am eager to explore and contribute to repositories that bridge **research and technology**. I want to work on projects that involve **mathematical modeling, data analysis, and AI-powered solutions**, and I am committed to learning from every challenge I encounter.  

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start exploring open source now. Donâ€™t wait until you are an expert. Every small contribution â€” adding examples, documenting research workflows, or implementing small algorithms â€” matters. **Consistency, curiosity, and willingness to learn** are the keys. Each PR you make is a step toward becoming a stronger developer and researcher ðŸš€
