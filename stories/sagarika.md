# My Coding Contribution Journey ðŸ’»

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Sagarika Dubey  
ðŸ“… **First Major Contribution:** October 2025  
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** GitHub, Python, Markdown, VS Code, Git  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
This year marks my very first Hacktoberfest participation! I had tried contributing to open source earlier, but I was too afraid and failed many times while even trying to create a good issue. That fear stopped me for a while. To overcome it, I decided to explore more about open source and finally joined Hacktoberfest 2025.  

My first step was smallâ€”learning how to open meaningful issues and contribute in simple ways. Each little success built my confidence and showed me that contributing doesnâ€™t require being an expert, just the willingness to learn and improve.  

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Donâ€™t be afraid of failingâ€”itâ€™s part of the journey. Start with small steps: fix a typo, improve documentation, or ask questions in the community. Every contribution matters, and each one builds your confidence. ðŸš€
