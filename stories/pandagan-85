# My Open Source Journey ✨

👤 **Name:** pandagan-85  
📅 **First Contribution:** October 2025  
🔧 **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, GitHub, Markdown

🌟 **My Experience:**  
I joined the open-source world during Hacktoberfest 2025, a bit curious and a bit intimidated. Coming from a design background, I wasn’t sure if I had enough technical experience to contribute. But I soon discovered that open source isn’t just about code — it’s about collaboration, creativity, and sharing what you know.

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**  
Don’t wait until you feel “expert” enough. Start small — improve documentation, fix accessibility issues, or explain a concept in your own words. Every contribution matters, and every PR helps you grow. 🚀
