# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

**ðŸ‘¤ Name:** Dhairya Bhatt
**ðŸ“… First Contribution:** 2022
**ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS
**ðŸŒŸ My Experience:** 
I began contributing to open source projects in 2022, starting with small fixes and documentation improvements before moving on to writing Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code. Over time, Iâ€™ve learned not just technical skills but also the importance of collaboration, code readability, and community-driven development. Working on open source has given me the chance to learn from others, contribute solutions that people actually use, and grow as a developer in ways that classroom projects alone could never provide.

**ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:** 
"More is lost with indecision than wrong decision" Think about this!
