ðŸŒŸ **My Journey:**  
I started contributing to open source during Hacktoberfest 2025. Initially, I was nervous and unsure how to start, but I began by contributing simple projects like DSA solutions and profile readmes. Each PR helped me understand Git, GitHub, and the process of making pull requests. Contributing to community repositories improved my coding skills, boosted my confidence, and made me feel part of the global open source community. I also learned the importance of writing clean, well-commented code.  

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small, follow contribution guidelines, and donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions. Every small contribution counts and helps you grow in the open source world.
