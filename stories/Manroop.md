ðŸ‘¤ **Name**: Manroop Kaur
ðŸ“… **First Contribution**: October 2025 (Hacktoberfest'25)
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used**: C++, Git, VS Code, GitHub, Python, JavaScript.

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience**:
I had always heard from my seniors and friends about the importance of contributing to open source, but I never really tried it. Now, with some free time after getting placed, I decided to give it a shot. Itâ€™s been 10 days since I started, and Iâ€™m truly enjoying the journey so far. Thereâ€™s something incredibly satisfying about seeing your pull request get merged, itâ€™s a feeling like no other. I hope to continue contributing and learning through open source in the future.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners**:
When I first started, I didnâ€™t know the slightest bit about contributing to open source, how to start, how to find the right repositories, or even how to raise an issue. I relied on Google and YouTube to learn the basics, and though I still make mistakes, I keep learning from them. My advice to beginners is simple: start small, explore, donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes, and keep experimenting. Every contribution, no matter how small, is a step forward and a great learning experience.
