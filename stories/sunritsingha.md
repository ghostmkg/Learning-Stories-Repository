# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Sunrit Singha  
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2024  
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Go, Docker, GitHub, FastAPI  

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2024. At first, I was nervous about contributing, thinking I needed to master complex frameworks before getting involved. But once I explored beginner-friendly repositories and read through contribution guides, I realized how welcoming the community truly is.  

My first pull request fixed a small bug in a Python API project. Seeing it merged gave me an incredible sense of accomplishment. Since then, Iâ€™ve contributed to backend tools, automation scripts, and even a few Docker-based projects. Open source has not only sharpened my coding skills but also taught me collaboration, patience, and the importance of clean documentation.  

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small and stay consistent. You donâ€™t need to build something hugeâ€”just contribute what you can. Even improving a README or fixing a minor bug can open doors to learning and growth. ðŸš€
