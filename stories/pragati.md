My open-source journey began with curiosity and the desire to learn beyond textbooks. As a Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Engineering student, I was always fascinated by how collaborative development shapes the world of technology. I made my first contribution by fixing documentation and improving code readability in a small repository â€” a simple start, but it boosted my confidence immensely.  

Through open-source, I learned the importance of writing clean, maintainable code, understanding version control, and collaborating effectively with developers worldwide. I also explored real-world projects involving algorithms, AI models, and automation, which deepened my technical understanding and problem-solving skills.  

Each pull request taught me something new â€” from handling merge conflicts to reviewing othersâ€™ code respectfully. Beyond coding, it helped me grow as a communicator and a team player.  

Open source has truly shaped my learning journey. Itâ€™s not just about code â€” itâ€™s about community, contribution, and continuous growth. I aim to keep contributing, learning, and inspiring others to start their own open-source adventures. ðŸš€
