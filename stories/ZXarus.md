# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** GitHub, Markdown, typescript, jsx,

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics, checking those small detials and testing.  

This is my one of the starting contributions to open sourcing and rn im just a begineer but in a couple of months from now i will be in a state where i can guide others into thr open sourcing community and bring them in while both of us gain something in.

My first PR was fixing a small typo in documentation/changing the colour of a button and it got merged! Its just done recently and im doing it now.

I recently joined the open sourcing and one of the admin as given me a freehand in doing wtever we wanted and have fun in creating and changing the colour schemes as much as want and it wil be okat to do wtever is needed cuz of many reasons and its honestly been a little fun and encourging to do it.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  

If u don't know where and what to know just ask someone and they'll help u as long as ur interested in doing it.

Take help from everyone and help others whenever they need and make sure its always right one to do it.
