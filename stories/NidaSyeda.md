# My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ **Name:** Nida Syeda  
ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025  
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, Markdown  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I began my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2025**. At first, I felt unsure about contributing because I thought open source was only for experienced developers. But then I found beginner-friendly projects that welcomed simple contributions like improving documentation and enhancing frontend design.  

My first PR was updating a projectâ€™s README and fixing minor UI issues â€” and it got merged! That small success gave me confidence to explore more projects and understand real-world collaboration.  

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Start small and stay consistent. Even the simplest contribution counts â€” whether itâ€™s improving docs, fixing UI, or adding a small feature. Every PR helps you grow and be part of something bigger. ðŸš€
