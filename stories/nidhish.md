ðŸ“… **First Contribution:** October 2025  
ðŸ”§ **Tools/Tech Used:** Github  

ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I started my open-source journey during Hacktoberfest 2025. At first, I was nervous about contributing because I thought I needed to be an expert in coding. But then I discovered projects that welcomed **non-code contributions** like improving documentation, writing tutorials, and designing simple graphics.  

I Profesionally am a Full Stack Web Developer, mastered MERN Stack, so work on React js, Tailwind CSS, Mongo DB, Express.
Have 2 clients till now, Laxmi cement Artile and Pixel Plus Media. 
Have never worked for money, always worked to improve myself.

ðŸ“Œ **Advice for Beginners:**  
Donâ€™t Chase Money if u have a lil bit skill, try mastering the skill untill it becomes that valuable that u can earn from it.
