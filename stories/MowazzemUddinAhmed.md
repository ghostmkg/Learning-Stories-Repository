My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Mowazzem Uddin Ahmed
ðŸ“… First Contribution: July 2025
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: Kubernetes, Docker, Git, YAML, Helm
ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
My open-source journey began about three months ago when I made my first contribution to a Kubernetes-related project. At first, it was overwhelming to understand the complex architecture and workflows, but with patience and community help, I quickly gained confidence. I learned how to manage deployments, write efficient Helm charts, and improve resource configurations. Each pull request taught me something newâ€”not just about Kubernetes, but also about teamwork and collaboration in open-source. Today, I feel proud to be part of a global community that thrives on knowledge sharing.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Start small but stay consistent. Even fixing a typo or updating documentation can open doors to learning and new opportunities.
