# My Open Source Journey ✨

**👤 Name:** Dhairya Bhatt
**📅 First Contribution:** 2022
**🔧 Tools/Tech Used:** Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS
**🌟 My Experience:** 
I began contributing to open source projects in 2022, starting with small fixes and documentation improvements before moving on to writing Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code. Over time, I’ve learned not just technical skills but also the importance of collaboration, code readability, and community-driven development. Working on open source has given me the chance to learn from others, contribute solutions that people actually use, and grow as a developer in ways that classroom projects alone could never provide.

**📌 Advice for Beginners:** 
"More is lost with indecision than wrong decision" Think about this!
