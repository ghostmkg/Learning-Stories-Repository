ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
My journey in open source began with curiosity and a passion for cybersecurity. As a pentester, I enjoy exploring vulnerabilities and making the web a safer place. Contributing to projects last year challenged my knowledge and connected me with a global community of like-minded individuals. Each pull request gave me confidenceâ€”whether I was adding a new script, improving documentation, or fixing a bug. I learned to collaborate, review code, and even teach others the basics of ethical hacking. Every project broadened my skills, from Python automation to API testing. Open source is not just about code; itâ€™s about growth, sharing, and creating real-world impact. Iâ€™m proud to help others secure their work while learning from experienced mentors. Hacktoberfest made me feel part of something much bigger.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Donâ€™t be afraid to ask questions or start smallâ€”every PR matters. Pick something youâ€™re genuinely curious about, read the documentation, and reach out for help if stuck. Open source thrives on collaboration and kindness; your contribution, however small, makes a difference!
