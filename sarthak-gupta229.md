My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Sarthak Gupta
ðŸ“… First Contribution: September 2025

ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git & GitHub

ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
I started my open source journey by contributing to beginner-friendly repositories on GitHub. My first PR was a small documentation fix, but it boosted my confidence. Over time, I learned to use Git commands effectively and collaborate with maintainers. Open source taught me how to communicate, debug efficiently, and write cleaner code. Seeing my code merged for the first time was an unforgettable moment!

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Donâ€™t wait to be an expert â€” start small, ask questions, and learn by doing. Every line of code counts!
