ðŸŒŸ **My Experience:**  
I began my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2024**. Initially, I felt unsure about where to start, but soon I realized that contributing to open source isnâ€™t just about writing complex code â€” itâ€™s also about learning, collaborating, and growing together with the community. Since then, Iâ€™ve contributed to multiple projects by adding DSA solutions, improving documentation, and enhancing front-end components.
