My Open Source Journey âœ¨

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Bubblegum ( Beginner ðŸ”° )
ðŸ“… First Contribution: October 2024
ðŸ”§ Tools/Tech Used: Python, FastAPI, SQLite, Git, GitHub Actions, Linux
ðŸŒŸ My Experience:
My open-source journey started with curiosity and chaos â€” poking around random repos, breaking things, and learning how to fix them. My first pull request felt like defusing a bomb (it was just a README fix, but still thrilling). Gradually, I moved to building real tools â€” from automating log parsers to crafting a mini-SIEM for home labs. The thrill of seeing your code merged into a global project is unmatched. Open source taught me discipline, teamwork, and the beauty of sharing knowledge freely. Every commit became a story of growth.

ðŸ“Œ Advice for Beginners:
Start small, but start now. Even a one-line fix counts â€” your journey begins with that single commit.
